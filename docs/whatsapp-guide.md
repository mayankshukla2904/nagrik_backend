}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Solution:**
- Ensure terminal supports QR code display
- Check internet connection
- Restart the service

#### 2. Connection Drops Frequently
**Problem:** WhatsApp connection keeps disconnecting
**Solution:**

- Ensure phone has stable WhatsApp connection
- Clear auth folder and re-authenticate

#### 3. Media Upload Failures
**Problem:** Images/videos not processing
**Solution:**

- Verify upload directory permissions
- Review file format support

#### 4. Backend Connection Issues
**Problem:** Complaints not submitting
**Solution:**

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging:
```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug npm start
```

### Health Check
The service provides a health check endpoint:
```bash
GET http://localhost:3001/health
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Session Security
- Auth files contain sensitive WhatsApp session data
- Keep `auth/` directory secure and backed up
- Don't share session files

### 2. File Upload Security
- Files are scanned for malicious content
- Only specific file types are allowed
- Files are stored securely with random names

### 3. Data Privacy
- User phone numbers are used as identifiers
- Messages are logged for debugging (can be disabled)
- No personal data is shared with third parties

## Deployment

### Production Deployment
1. **Use Process Manager:**
```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start src/whatsapp.js --name "nagrik-whatsapp"
```

2. **Set Production Environment:**
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
LOG_LEVEL=error
```

3. **Configure Nginx (if needed):**
```nginx
location /whatsapp/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3001/;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
}
```

### Scaling Considerations
- Each WhatsApp number requires a separate service instance
- Use different session names for multiple instances
- Consider load balancing for high-volume deployments

## Advanced Features

### Multi-language Support
Add language detection and responses:
```javascript
const userLanguage = detectLanguage(message);
const response = getLocalizedMessage(userLanguage, 'welcome');
```

### Custom Workflows
Implement department-specific workflows:
```javascript
if (category === 'Emergency') {
  // Immediate escalation flow
  await escalateToEmergencyServices(complaint);
}
```

### Integration with Other Services
Connect to additional services:
```javascript
// SMS notifications
await sendSMSConfirmation(phoneNumber, complaintId);

// Email alerts
await sendEmailToOfficials(complaint);
```

## Support

For technical support and questions:
- Check logs in `logs/whatsapp.log`
- Review the troubleshooting section
- Contact the development team
- Submit issues to the project repository

## API Integration

The WhatsApp service integrates with the backend API:
- **POST /api/complaints/report** - Submit complaints
- **GET /api/complaints/:id** - Check status
- Health checks and monitoring

This ensures consistent data flow and real-time updates across all channels.
